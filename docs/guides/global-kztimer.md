description: Guide for KZTimer on how to get your server globally whitelisted
---

# Requirements

- Server owners cannot be globally banned or have a previous global ban.
- Must not be a LAN or locally-hosted server. Regardless of whether it's open to the public.
- If the server is going to be password protected or SteamID/group whitelisted, then replay bot files must be accessible to the Global Team. The Global Team must be able to access the server (add them to the whitelist or share the password).
- You have read, understood and comply with the [Global Server Owner Code of Conduct](https://forum.gokz.org/p/server-rules).
