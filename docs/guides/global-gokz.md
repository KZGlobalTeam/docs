title: GOKZ global whitelist guide
description: Guide for GOKZ on how to get your server globally whitelisted
---

# Requirements

- Server owners cannot be globally banned or have a previous global ban.
- Must not be a LAN or locally-hosted server. Regardless of whether it's open to the public.
- If the server is going to be password protected or SteamID/group whitelisted, then replay bot files must be accessible to the Global Team. The Global Team must be able to access the server (add them to the whitelist or share the password).
- You have read, understood and comply with the [Global Server Owner Code of Conduct](https://forum.gokz.org/p/server-rules).

## Before you begin

1. This guide assumes that you have a working GOKZ server.
2. This guide assumes that you have access to the server files.

::: warning
If you are asked to overwrite files at any point in the guide, accept the overwrites.

::: warning
If you are having trouble with a step, try the **#support** channel in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/csgokz).
<br>Be sure to mention which step you are having trouble with and include as much information as possible, including the error logs from `csgo/addons/sourcemod/logs/errors_********.log`.

## 1. Install SteamWorks

1. Start by downloading [SteamWorks](http://users.alliedmods.net/~kyles/builds/SteamWorks).

2. Extract the files into your server's `csgo` directory.

3. You should now have SteamWorks installed and working.

::: info Confirm this step
Run the following command in the server console: `sm exts load SteamWorks`.
<br>You should see the following line in the output: `[SM] Loaded extension SteamWorks.ext.so successfully.`.

## 2. Install GlobalAPI plugin

1. Start by downloading [GlobalAPI-SMPlugin](https://bitbucket.org/kztimerglobalteam/globalapi-smplugin/downloads).

2. Extract the files into your server's `csgo` directory.

3. You should now have GlobalAPI-SMPlugin installed and working.

::: info Confirm this step
Restart your server and type `sm plugins list` in the server console.
<br>You should see the following line in the output: `GlobalAPI (2.0.4)`.

## 4. Verify configuration of the server

Install the [KZ Server Advisor Plugin](https://bitbucket.org/kztimerglobalteam/kzserveradvisor).

Use the `sm_kzserveradvisor_gokz` command.
